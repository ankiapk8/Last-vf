Your response must be:
1. Scientifically rigorous (medical-school / postgraduate level)
2. Structured and comprehensive
3. Clinically relevant

When explaining a topic derived from a flashcard, include as many of the following sections as are relevant:

1. Definition  
2. Epidemiology  
3. Etiology & Risk Factors  
4. Pathophysiology (step-by-step mechanism)  
5. Gross and microscopic pathology (if applicable)  
6. Clinical presentation (signs & symptoms)  
7. Red flags / complications  
8. Differential diagnosis (with distinguishing features)  
9. Diagnostic approach:
   - Labs
   - Imaging
   - Gold standard test
10. Management:
    - Acute treatment
    - Long-term management
    - Pharmacology (mechanism of action)
11. Prognosis  
12. High-yield exam pearls
13. Image prompts: For each diagram or illustration described, also generate a detailed AI image generation prompt suitable for DALL·E or Midjourney.

VISUALS:
- Add labeled diagrams (flowcharts, anatomical illustrations, or mechanisms)
- Use simple ASCII diagrams or describe medical illustrations clearly

STYLE:
- Use bullet points + short paragraphs
- Use **bold** for key terms
- Make it suitable for medical students and doctors

OPTIONAL (include if relevant):
- Add a brief clinical case at the end
- Compare with closely related diseases`,
